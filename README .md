### Overview


This project anaylyzes movie data from the following datasets:__[Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)__, __[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)__, __[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)__,__[TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)__,
and __[The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)__. The intention behind investigating this data is to provide executable buisness strategies for Microsoft's new movie studio. Descriptive analysis of movie data shows that the highest grossing movies have a correlated relationship to movie rating, the length of the movie, and the budget of the movie. Microsoft's new studio executives can use this analysis as the framework for making new profitable movies.


### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data
 The movie datasets include thousands of movies ranging from 1962 all the way to future films scheduled up to 2026 with titles,dates, profits, and othe relevant information.
In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three business recommendations for creating a profitable movie at Microsoft Studios:

- __A bigger budget correlates to bigger box office earnings.__ While this does not guarantee a successful movie, people are drawn toward higher-quality films more often than not.

- __Plan to make a movie that is 120-180 minutes long.__ The trends are clear, 2 hours is often where the best sellers fall into.

- __Make family friendly movies. I.e rated PG-13 or PG.__ This will result in a higher boxoffice because there is a larger target audience.

## Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights to further improve operations at Microsoft Studios:

- __Find the relationship between critic ratings and boxoffice.__ This understanding could help in knowing necessary steps to present movies to critics or if they are necessary at all.

- __Model movie success bases on the names of actors involved.__ This analysis could provide insight into which actors are the most profitable.
