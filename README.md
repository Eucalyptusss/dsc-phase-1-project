### Overview


This project anaylyzes movie data from the following datasets:__[Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)__, __[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)__, __[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)__,__[TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)__,
and __[The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)__. The intention behind investigating this data is to provide executable buisness strategies for Microsoft's new movie studio. Descriptive analysis of movie data shows that the highest grossing movies have a correlated relationship to movie rating, the length of the movie, and the budget of the movie. Microsoft's new studio executives can use this analysis as the framework for making new profitable movies.


### Business Problem

To ensure that Microsoft impresses shareholders with its decision to enter the movie industry I investigate data about common movie trends. During my investigation, I have discovered common movie characteristics that impact gross revenue. 
By implementing my recommendations Microsoft can output higher gross movie revenues.


### The Data
 The movie datasets include thousands of movies ranging from 1962 all the way to future films scheduled up to 2026 with titles,dates, profits, and othe relevant information.
In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)



## Methods

This project uses desciptive analysis, including description of trends over time. This provides a useful overview of the relationship between movie trends and movie characteristics.


## Results
Movies with a higher productin budget are more likely to have higher domestic/worldwide gross revenue.

Having a length of  [60-120) have twice the average amount in worldwide gross revenue.

## Conclusions

This analysis leads to three business recommendations for creating a profitable movie at Microsoft Studios:

Expect gross revenue to reflect  production budget

Plan a movie that is 60-120 minutes long

Make a movie  that is family friendly i.e. PG-13 /  PG


## Next Steps

Further analyses could yield additional insights to further improve operations at Microsoft Studios:

-Repeating the results from above but based on genre would give insight into which genres Microsoft  should invest in.

-An investigation into the relationship between actors involved in the movies and the gross revenue would provide Microsoft an informed recommendation about who to cast.
